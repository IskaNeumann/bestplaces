## Structure
Because of our server-client-structure, we decided to use two different repositories to devide server and client, which both are written in different languages. You are able to acces the [client](https://github.com/anonfreak/bestplaces-client) and the [server](https://github.com/anonfreak/bestplaces-server) by using the links.
## What's this repo about?
This repo will contain all information, which matches both components. Therfore, it's the main repo for documentation purposes.
